# BashScripts
Contains my useful bash scripts. I have many more than listed here. Actively uploading as I think of it.
1. Docking small TMCs by centroids into large structures -- Dock_COM
2. Analyzing amino acid frequencies from a large amount of fasta sequences (agrees with webservers) -- AA_COUNT
3. XYZ trajectory splicing- take a trajectory of arbitrary size and abstract out individual frames and prep QM calculation input files and job submission scripts.
